1) Goals and Overview
   1) To create a class with attributes, constructors and behaviors 
   2) To create an array of objects
   3) Instance methods, static variables and static methods
   4) Create a new project for the quiz and call it Ecommerce
      Overview: In this quiz, you will be implementing a Product Class that’s a blueprint
      of e-commerce product’s attributes and behaviors. A Shop class that will contain the
      main function and 5 product objects. You will create a shopping menu for the user
      using an array of these 5 products.
2) The Product Class
   1) Product will have the following attributes:
      • String name
      • double price
      • String category
      • int quantity
      • char size
      • String author
      • String color
   2) Constructors:
      • Some products are apparel so they will have name,
      price, category, quantity, size, color
      • Some products are books and they’ll have name,
      price, category, quantity, author
      • Some products are soap and they’ll have name, price,
      category and quantity
      • We will not create the default constructor 
   3) All attributes will be private and they will have public getters and setters. You will
      be using getters and setters when other classes access Product’s attributes. Inside
      the Product class, you should be using this.attributeName
   4) Create a toString method to print all the attributes. You can use the eclipse shortcut
      to create constructors, getters setters and toString method.
   5) Instance Method : buy() - This method will not take any parameters and will
      return a boolean. Decide the method signature accordingly. Inside this method:
      • Check if the quantity of the product is greater than 0
      • If it is, reduce the quantity by 1 (use appropriate operator that would change
      the product’s quantity in memory) and return true,
      • Otherwise, return false
3) Shop Class
   1) Attributes:
       • A static double variable called totalAmount initialized to 0
       • A static array called inventory of 5 Product objects
       We’ll learn to declare and initialize an array of objects in one line. We can use
       this technique in our future projects when it’s appropriate. Check point 8
       below for syntax before writing the array in your code.
   2) 0th index of inventory will reference to a new Product object and the attributes
       would be name: Business Ritual Women’s Long Sleeve Top , price: 65. 39,
       category: Apparel, quantity: 4, size: L, color: Blue
   3) 1st index of inventory will reference to a new Product object and the attributes
       name: The Art of Computer Programming , price: 190. 54, category: Books,
       quantity: 9, author: Donald E. Knuth
   4) 2nd index of inventory will reference to a new Product object and the attributes
       name: Men’s Business Casual Shirt , price: 57. 10, category: Apparel, quantity:
       2, size: M, color: Teal
   5) 3rd index of inventory will reference to a new Product object and the attributes
         name: Organic Turmeric Soap , price: 11. 25, category: Bath & Beauty,
         quantity: 1
   6) 4th index of inventory will reference to a new Product object the attributes name:
      Head First Design Pattern, price: 37. 35, category: Books, quantity: 3, author:
      Eric Freeman
   7) To declare and initialize an array of objects in one line, you can use the following
      syntax:
      ClassName[] arrayName = {new ClassName(parameters), new
      ClassName(parameters)…}
      Example for an array called employees with 3 FullTime objects:
      static FullTime[] employees = {new FullTime("XYZ", 12.5,
      "22"), new FullTime("ABC", 8.2, "55-55"), new
      FullTime("TTT", 5.17, “83-55")};
   8) A static method called displayMenu() which would return nothing:
      • It prints the statement “\nEnter the product index (0 to 4) you
      want to buy. To exit the shopping cart, enter any number
      other than 0 to 4”
      • It prints the product index : product Name. To display the index number :
      product name in the menu, use a for loop to loop through the inventory array.
      Inside the loop print your index : inventory[index]’s getter for name attribute.
      Output in section 5 shows how your menu will look like.
   9) Inside the main method:
      • Declare an int variable called userInput
      • You would need a Scanner object to take user input. Make sure to close the
      input stream before your main method ends
      • Run a menu option inside a do while loop that runs as long as userInput is
      between 0 and 4. Inside the do while loop:
       ➢ Call the displayMenu() Method
         ➢ Take an integer as userInput
         ➢ check if userInput is between 0 and 4
         ➢ Inside the if statement, you’ll have another if statement to call
         inventory[userInput]’s buy method – the method call should be
         within an if condition (Since the buy method returns boolean you can put
         the method call as if (method call)). If buy returns true, print “Your
         purchase was successful” and add that product’s price to
         totalAmount. Otherwise, print “Sorry! This product is out of
         stock.”
         ➢ NOTE: You will be checking the condition between 0 to 4 twice, once for the
         while loop and once inside the loop. This method can be more efficient using the
         extra credit section which is optional.
         • Once the do while loop has ended, print “Thank you for shopping with us! The
         total amount is ” + totalAmount
4) Notes, Implementation and Submission
   1) Time limit is 3 hours with a 15 minute break in between
   2) Hint: To call an object’s method that returns boolean, inside an if statement, you
      would write if(employee[0].isManager())
   3) Design the flow of your program on a white sheet first
   4) Write comments and indent your code
   5) Your instructor or your colleague can only help you with logical errors or
      understanding of the program. No one is supposed to help/seek help for syntax
      errors, semicolon, typo, curly braces or datatype errors.
   6) Do not google anything except syntax if required, and keep your instructor
      informed. You can use your textbook, class & homework materials/programs for
      reference.
   7) Extra Credit : Change the do-while loop to a forever while(true) loop. Break
      (keyword is break) the loop if userInput is not between 0 and 4.
   8) Submit both .java file
